# Agric

Agriculture-oriented iconic web font.

## Compilation

Agric is composed of many fonts. To merge them in one consistent set, many tools are used:

    cd lib/compiler
    sudo apt-get install nodejs npm fontforge
    npm install svg-font-dump svg-font-create svgo

If you don't have Node JS in your distribution you can compile it easily from its sources.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'agric'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install agric
